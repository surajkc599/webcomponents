#Overview

An ivestigation to see how webcomponents have been evolved and how we can leverage those in different frameworks.

1. Native Vanilla-js Development
2. lit-element
3. StencilJS
4. Svelte

The idea is to create Simple progressbar component in all the above mentioned frameworks/libraries/compiler and to see which fits best for Design system or component library development.

StencilJS stands best because of:

1. lazy loading of components
2. ability to provide react/vue/angular bindings for web components
3. simple to develop, documentation is very clear
4. Strong roadmap


All the experimented source code is available in there respective directories.
